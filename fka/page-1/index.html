        <h4>fka twigs, magdalene, the case for the divine feminine and the androgyn OR<br>
        fka twigs, magdalene, the decolonization and reinterpretation of christianity</h4><br>
        <p>FKA Twigs’s second studio album titled MAGDALENE is comprised of nine songs, all written and produced by the English singer. Three music videos and recently, a short film titled, “sad day” have been released to accompany the project.The songs detail the trappings of a relationship, and in my opinion, the failure of gender roles in our society at large.<br><br>

         The first single released, along with an accompanying music video, is the track “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84">cellophane</a>”. It starts with Twigs disrobing to disembodied applause, stepping slowly and sensually in “pleaser” shoes and a scant two-piece. From there she ascends to the pole, contracting and expanding her body as the mirrored ceiling begins to waver and distort before opening to a silky heaven inhabited by a flying golden beast. </p><br><br>
         <h2>“And didn’t I do it for you? Why couldn’t you do it for me?”</h2><br><br>

        <p>The beast, composed of golden piping reminiscent of the two-piece she is wearing, approaches the singer before discarding its three faces, revealing Twigs’ own. Shocked, Twigs presses the bottom of her heel to it, dissolving the beast and falling through it, unable to cling to an anonymous hand, into a voidal dark, accompanied only by scarves and flashing lights. Very briefly she takes to the pole again. Twigs lands onto a bed of clay mud, greeted by hunched masked women who recognize familiarity in her before being caressed by them. </p><br><br>
        <h2> “They’re waiting, they’re watching. They’re watching us, they’re hating. And hoping, I’m not enough.”</h2><br><br>
        <p>Mary Magdalene, the namesake of the album, was one of the earliest followers of Jesus Christ, and the only one who truly understood his message. Her story is painted in broad strokes as a reformed sex worker who found glory in God, and whose love for Jesus reshaped her. “Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went Seven Devils”. Mary and Mary Magdalene were the two most prominent women in Jesus’s life, and can be seen as character foils of womanhood. Mary, mother of Christ was born without sin and was the only suitable vessel to house the Holy Spirit. She can be seen as the world’s purest representation of a perfect woman. She led a perfectly Godly life, lived in veneration to her husband, and was perfectly passive, even in her Immaculate Conception.<br><br>

        Magdalene, on the other hand, was a more contentious spirit. Her gender, hotly debated past as a prostitute, and proximity to Christ, leaves her as somewhat of an enigma of the Christian faith. It is worth noting that Magdalene does not embody the wild feminine of say, the Jewish demoness Lilith, but instead constructs order for herself within Christ’s teaching.</p> <br><br>

        <p>Magdalene can be racialized in that women of color are often exotified and sensualized from an earlier age. In the beginning of cellophane, we see Twigs outside of herself, posited as both a sexual object and angelic beast. Twigs contrasts these with each other, and with the beast’s destruction, suggests that they cannot exist in the same space as each other. While this caused a cognitive dissonance for me with the piece at first, I realize that this half of the video is still taking place on a stage, on a pedestal. As she falls, lights resembling the carnal eye of media flash erratically, and shots of Twigs descending are spliced with her dancing around the pole. At the end, as she’s being healed by members of her community, she stops contorting her body, and sits upright, cradling herself, before making direct eye contact with the camera, addressing it for the first time. <br><br></p>
