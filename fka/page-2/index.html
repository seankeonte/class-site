        <h4>fka twigs, magdalene, the case for the divine feminine and the androgyn OR<br>
        fka twigs, magdalene, the decolonization and reinterpretation of christianity</h4><br>
        <p>The video for the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Rro6TQgpU">home with you</a>” has a similar tonal shift. It starts with a flashing club scene, the inhabitants dancing provocatively in dark, revealing clothing and loud prints. Twigs is shown in a collaged ensemble, with a victorian-style asymmetrical magenta puffed sleeve complete with a blue ribbon, crossed in a deep V with a black and white top. Her makeup is just as loud, with a metallic lip reminiscent of the early Ke$ha era. One eye is hidden by a glossy, alien-like covering, an allusion to the lyrics, “You’ve never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi”, and refers to her feelings of alienation in the current setting. It also resembles black onyx, mentioned in the line “When I visualize, all I see is black.” This gemstone is used to heal old injuries and regain confidence in one’s inner world. <br><br>

        The theme of eyes continues as she leaves her friends unconscious in the car they were driving, painted blue eyes staring into the sky. Twigs walks, stoic, towards a field of white laundry, where she is seen being caressed and warded by an older Black female figure, both of them in shapeless white dresses, Twigs trading the alien eye for a bandage. The figure invokes the aesthetics of Candomblé, a religion in Brazil created by Black slaves who continued to practice Yoruba witchcraft under the guise of Catholicism in order to appease their white captors. Twigs is telling a story of liberation and assimilation. She rejects the hypersexualized view of womanhood placed on her, instead allowing herself to exist outside the cishet and white supremacist gaze placed on black women. <br><br></p>

        <p>At the beginning of the song she mentions both apples and cherries, followed by the line, “Pain. Breathe in, breathe out, pain.” Following the biblical references in the album, apples represent womanhood, Eve creating sin by taking a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, and punishing the women who would come after her. The most iconic image of cherries are two of the fruit joined at the top of their stems, reminiscent of male genitalia. Twigs spends the entire video blinded in one eye, unable to see out of the narrow lense she has placed on herself. By the end, the viewer is surprised to find that the “you” she has been pleading with to open up and accept her love is not a romantic partner, but a younger version of herself. She pulls herself out of a well, child Twigs dressed in a manner adolescent Victorian boys would be raised in, that is to say a frilled dress. The child tries to undo Twig’s corset, and Twigs pushes her away to do it herself, revealing an eye in place of her navel.
