        <h4>ka twigs, magdalene, the case for the divine feminine and the androgyn OR<br>
        fka twigs, magdalene, the decolonization and reinterpretation of christianity</h4><br>
        <p>In contrast with the elegiac “cellophane” and “home with you”, in “holy terrain” Twigs stops questioning herself and starts to assert her needs in a partnership. No longer does she don soft, loose curls, but instead her hair (and the hair of her accompanying dancers) is woven into tight plaits. They are dressed in black lace and pants, dancing on cracked earth during a heavily overcast day. Twigs again alludes to her embodying aspects pertaining to both masculinity and femininity, one of her eyes red and one blue. “I’m blue when the Moon hits my skin right. Hot pink when you open up my sweet thighs.” Later she is shown fluttering at night in a white gown. <br><br>

        Twigs contrasts the expectations of women in heterosexual relationships, where they are meant to be caretakers of the men in their lives. “Will you still be there for me, once I’m yours to obtain? Once my fruits are for taking and you flow through my veins?” This contrasts with the barren landscape the video takes place. “Pray for my sins, make me stronger where I’m weak, yeah.” Future, who is featured on the song, retorts. Twigs is looking for a man who is complete in himself, who doesn’t fall into the trappings of hypermasculinity, who performs for the other men in his life. “For a man who can follow his heart, not get bound by his boys and his chains”.<br><br>

        Future invokes the devil in the first verse of the song. The Devil, a card in the original illustrations that make up a tarot deck, shows two lovers bound by the neck, and chained to the horned demon Baphomet, who originally represented a balance between good and evil, and the masculine and feminine. In “On the Issue of Roles” by Toni Cade Bambara, she states that one of the biggest obstacles for Black people in capturing freedom is subscribing to the European idea of gender roles. There is so much divisiveness in the black community between the genders that it leads to the breakdown of any movement towards a possible future when the movements of either are constantly being hyper-analyzed and critiqued. “It seems to me you find your Self in destroying illusions, smashing myths, laundering the head of whitewash, being responsible to some truth, to the struggle. That entails at the very least cracking through the veneer of this sick society’s definition of ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’.”

        FKA Twigs’ second studio album Magdalene purses her bowstring and pierces the soul of the listener. As the arrow arcs, she addresses the historical baggage with our religious symbols, which remains the backbone of our society, and asks the listener to embark on a journey of transformation. She battles against the misogyny and racism towards black femininity, instead showing us the fertility and boundless love that is found there. If we are to ever be free of the shackles on earth, we have to go on a journey into the soul and sow what we find there, the nurturing nature of the divine feminine and the forthrightness of masculinity. Only once we maintain that balance in ourselves can we find true justice.<br><br></p>
